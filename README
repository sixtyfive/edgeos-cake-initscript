Disclaimer: these binaries ONLY work on EdgeRouter Lite devices!
They overwrite stock binaries and can render the system unusable.
Be sure you know how to load stock firmware again.

To install on an EdgeRouter Lite:

1. Run ./package.sh and copy resulting .tar.gz to /home/$YOUR_USER
2. Execute the following:

  $ sudo su
  # cd /
  # tar xvf /home/$YOUR_USER/cake-binaries-modules-and-scripts-ERLite3-only.tar.gz

3. Run "cake" and read the usage information. You can now keep using it on the commandline
   to experiment with different settings until the results are satisfiying.
4. Copy /config/cake.example to /config/cake and edit to make your preferred settings the default.
5. Make Cake start automatically during boot (be careful with this):

  # cd /etc/rc2.d
  # ln -s /etc/init.d/cake S99cake

Please note that upgrading the firmware will require you to run step 2 again!
